# deep-q-learning-scratch

Hello guys! welcome to this repository. This repository is for me to learn hot to translates from a research paper into an actual codes. The research i was trying to implement named [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).  

You can see the code i wrote for this research paper in the notebooks `DeepQ Learning Algorithm`. For the game itself i handcrafted it manually. The game is pretty simple, the main goal is to make a player (number 1) moving towards into a target (number 2). You can play the game itself by running the python on `own_game.py` file.  

To see the agent is playing correctly, you can check the notebooks and go to the `Playing` section. On that notebook, the agent can move correctly and going towards the target.  

I analyze the model by running a tensorboard while on training phase. You can check the history and the logs by running tensorboard command `tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard`.  

Thanks for checking it out!
